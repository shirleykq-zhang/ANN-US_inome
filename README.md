We aim to predict whether the individual has an income of over $50,000 per year based on their demographic characteristics using a neural network. Our best model is a 3-layer artificial neural network that considers 40 attributes and makes the correct prediction 85.4% of the time. The model shows hours worked per week, whether one’s native country is the US, and the sector of one’s job are the most significant attributes for prediction.
